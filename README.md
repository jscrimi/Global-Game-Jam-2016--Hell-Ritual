# Global-Game-Jam-2016--Hell-Ritual
A bullet hell game made for Global Game Jam 2016.

To play, simply run the file: Hell Ritual-Default-1.8.5.50.exe

This game is based off the Japanese bullet hell shooter series "Touhou"
The object of the game is to shoot down the boss (normally at the top of the screen), while
dodging the projectiles shot during several waves of non-spells and Spellcards.
Getting hit by a bullet lowers your life (your health bar is displayed at the bottom of the screen)
If your life reaches 0 at any time, you lose.
Not getting hit by a bullet for 5 seconds triggers a slow regeneration effect that will gradually
fill your health back up to the maximum.

Bullet patterns may look crazy, but you get some leeway; your hitbox is a small white dot that hovers over
the player character's sprite. You will only lose life if a bullet collides with that dot, and if one does,
other nearby bullets will be cleared.
